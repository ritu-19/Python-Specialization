<p><b> Under the Python Specialization by University of Michigan on Coursera, I covered the following courses:</b></p>

<p>1. <b>Using Python to Access Web Data:</b> Under this course, I worked on scraping, parsing and reading web data as well as accessing the data using Web APIs. During the course, I worked with HTML, XML, and JSON data formats in Python. </p>
<p> During this course, I worked on various assignments:</p>
<ul>

  </ul>
  
  <p> 2. <b> Using Databases With Python: </b> Under this course, I worked on designing databases for storing data as part of a multi-step data gathering, analysis abd processing effort. </p> 
  <ul>
  <li>I used use Structural Query Languages (SQLite3) as its database. </li>
  <li>I <b>built web crawlers and multi-step data gathering and performed visualization using D3.js </b>library. </li>
